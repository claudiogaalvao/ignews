That's a project of content subscription about React News, that I started with the objective to apply NextJs concepts. In that project I worked with Sass, CSS Modules, TypeScript, FaunaDB integration and explore concepts like SSR (Server-side Rendering) and SSG (Static Site Generation). There's a possibility to subscribe to access the articles, so I integrated with an external payment API (Stripe).
